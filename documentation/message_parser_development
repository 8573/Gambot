The job of a message parser is very simple.

1. Start.
2. Receive message.
3. Chop up message.
4. React to the message (see: gambot_api_language documentation).
5. Stop.

As soon as the message parser starts it should read three lines from STDIN. Respectively those are:

1. The "pipe id" of this message parser.
  The first message after a new connection (including reconnects) will be "fork0".
  We recommend executing auto-join lists on forks after at least 10. This way you know the connection was successful.
  You can also use this to do certain setup stuff on the bot.
2. The nickname the bot is currently using.
3. The incoming message.

All of those should have their new-lines and carriage-returns chopped off of the end.

The incoming message will be raw IRC as per RFC 1459.

Next you should parse the message however you want (regular expressions are nice) and react to it.

You can, at any time, output GAPIL commands to STDOUT (see: gambot_api_language documentation).

Make sure your message parser exits. They are not meant to stay running. Otherwise you will collect several thousand running processes.
