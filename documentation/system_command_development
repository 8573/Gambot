Gambot now allows arbitrary system commands to be executed. It is assumed that these commands will output GAPIL (see: gambot_api_language documentation).

They can be as simple as a text file full of commands (run cat on the text file) that are used as a macro, or as advanced as some sort of state manager or web front end.
You are able to keep commands running constantly.

They will receive one message in STDIN at startup. This is the "pipe id" of your command
It is sent in case you want to be able to identify yourself to other pipes when using send_pipe_message>
If you plan to receieve messages later on STDIN, you should make sure to read this one out first.
