When writing a Gambot processor, timer, or other script (perhaps a wrapper that prints into Gambot's STDIN) these are the valid options.
The code can be found in modules/Gambot/Parser.pm

send>[message]
	Sends [message] to the IRC server

quit>[message]
	Quits with the message of [message]

log>[message]
	Puts [message] in the logs.

error>[message]
	Puts [message] in the logs, but denotes it as an error.

core_value>[name]>[value]
	Sets $core{'[name]'} = [value]
	Valid names are only lowercase letters and underscores

config_value>[name]>[value]
	Sets $config{'[name]'} = [value]
	Valid names are only lowercase letters and underscores

reload_config>
	Reloads the configuration file.

sleep>[number]
	Sleeps for [number] seconds. 
	Can be a decimal.
	A value of 0.5 is recommended for throttling sending of messages.

start_script>[system command]
	Starts a fork named [name] that executes [system command]
	YOU SHOULD NEVER EXPOSE THIS TO IRC USERS
	The output of these commands will be read as Gambot API calls
	These commands should have Gambot clean up after them with end>

end>
	This is a dummy call that scripts and processors should print as their last line
	While not essential, it causes Gambot to clean up information associated with the fork
