When writing a Gambot processor, timer, or other script (perhaps a wrapper that prints into Gambot's STDIN) these are the valid options.
The code can be found in modules/Gambot/Parser.pm

send>[message]
	Sends [message] to the IRC server

quit>[message]
	Quits with the message of [message]

timer>
	Activates the timer script. 
	Make sure that you manually triggering it won't interfere with the automatic triggering.

log>[message]
	Puts [message] in the logs.

error>[message]
	Puts [message] in the logs, but denotes it as an error.

core_value>[name]>[value]
	Sets $core{'[name]'} = [value]
	Valid names are only lowercase letters and underscores

config_value>[name]>[value]
	Sets $config{'[name]'} = [value]
	Valid names are only lowercase letters and underscores

reload_config>
	Reloads the configuration file.

sleep>[number]
	Sleeps for [number] seconds. 
	Can be a decimal.
	A value of 0.5 is recommended for throttling sending of messages.
