************************************

********** i. Licensing

This program's licensing information can be found in COPYING.
If COPYING is not present you may not have received this program
from an official source.

********** ii. Setup

Setting up Gambot is very simple. There are no prerequisites
besides perl 5.10 or later. Run Gambot.pl and it will ask you a 
few questions.

********** iii. Directories and files

In the root directory you should see Gambot.pl which is the main
script.

gamb_connect.pm, gamb_output.pm, and gamb_terminal.pm contain
also contain source code pertinent to the main script.

processors/example_processor.pl is an example processor script.
This will be kept up to date as we upgrade things. It serves as a
template for you to use for creating and upgrading your own bot
configurations.

processors/plugins/ contains all the default plugins. Plugin
files contain code for related commands. If you're developing your
own plugins, processors/plugins/version.pm serves as a good template.

********** iv. Hosting Gambot

Gambot requires at least 20MB of memory to run. 30MB or more is
recommended. It is a very fractured, and threaded program. Memory can
be saved by reducing the number of processing threads in Gambot.pl or
by forgoing the terminal thread all togethor.

The processor requirements should be minimal except during startup.

We recommend storing your logs in logs/bot_name_goes_here/
