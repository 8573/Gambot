1. About Gambot
  Gambot is an IRC bot framework. It is written in perl.
  Major features include:

  1. Speed - The core is very lean and very fast.
  2. Full Asynchronism - Messages don't get parsed in order.
	If you have certain commands that take longer (maybe they require network
	resources) they won't slow down the entire bot.
  3. On the fly updates - The only time you have to reconnect or restart is when
	updating the core. If you're only changing/fixing message parsers or
	commands, you can stay live.
  4. Code in any language - The core is written in perl, but you can extend it in
	any programming language you want. As long as it can read STDIN and print
	to STDOUT, it will work.

2. Setting up
  Setting up Gambot is actually really simple. Just run setup.pl and answer a few
  questions.

  From there you'll have to follow the setup instructions of whatever add-ons,
  parsers, and extensions you're using.

3. Coding for Gambot
  There are files in the documentation folder about all the different aspects of
  programming for Gambot. The code is also well commented, and several example
  extensions and parsers are included.
